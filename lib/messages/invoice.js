 * A DZINCRTE Invoice message. From the Whitepaper:
 * > Invoices are primarily needed to establish a meaningful reputation
 * > evaluation of the seller. When a buyer purchases an item from a seller,
 * > funds must be sent to the seller following an invoice declaration. Funds
 * > received by sellers without a preceding invoice, should not add credit to
 * > the sellerâ€™s reputation. 
 * >
 * > The output address for this transaction type is addressed to the 
 * > buyer, and not to the seller, so as to aid with reputation assessment.
 *
 * **receiverAddr**: Invoices should be addressed to the public address of the
 *  buyer who will be paying for an item.
 *
 * **NOTE**: All attributes that are specified below are also getter properties
 *  that can be accessed on this instantiated object.
 *
 * @class Invoice
 * @extends module:messages~MessageBase
 * @param {Driver} connection - blockchain connection
 * @param {object} attrs - Attributes that this Invoice contains
 * @param {Integer} attrs.amountDue - The amount due, denoted in satoshis, which 
 *  does not include tipping fees.
 * @param {Integer} attrs.expirationIn - The expiration time of this invoice.
 *  "Times" are to be indicated in the number of blocks that this listing is 
 *  available for. Omitting this field indicates no expiration.
